</p>

This is the last official **Badlion Client** `.exe` installer released before Lunar Client replaced it with their own `.exe`,

Although this is intended for **archival and offline use**, the Badlion Client itself still functions **online** including multiplayer features, cosmetics, and anticheat as long as the official servers remain active.
